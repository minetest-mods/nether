# Nether Mod for Minetest, with Portals API.

Allows Nether portals to be constructed, opening a gateway between the surface
realm and one of lava and netherrack, with rumors of a passageway through the
netherrack to a great magma ocean.

To view the options provided by this mod, see settingtypes.txt or
go to "Settings"->"All Settings"->"Mods"->"nether" in the game.

A Nether portal is built as a rectangular vertical frame of obsidian, 4 blocks
wide and 5 blocks high. Once constructed, a Mese crystal fragment can be
right-click/used on the frame to activate it.


## Modders and game designers

See portal_api.txt for how to create custom portals to your own realms.

This mod provides Nether basalts (natural, hewn, and chiseled) as nodes which
require a player to journey to the magma ocean to obtain, so these can be used
for gating progression through a game. For example, a portal to another realm
might need to be constructed from basalt, thus requiring a journey through
the nether first, or basalt might be a crafting ingredient required to reach
a particular branch of the tech-tree.

Netherbrick tools are provided (pick, shovel, axe, & sword), see tools.lua

Nether Portals can allow surface fast-travel.
